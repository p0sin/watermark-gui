# Watermark GUI

Watermark GUI is a Python application built using Tkinter and PIL (Python Imaging Library) for adding text watermarks to images. This simple graphical user interface allows users to import an image, customize text parameters such as font, size, color, and opacity, and then overlay the text onto the image. Additionally, users can export the watermarked image to a specified location.

## Features

- Import an image to add text watermarks.
- Customize text parameters including font, size, color, and opacity.
- Overlay text onto the image with a preview in real-time.
- Position the text by clicking on the preview canvas.
- Export the watermarked image to a specified location.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (Python Imaging Library)
- CustomTkinter library (assuming it's a custom implementation of Tkinter, replace this with standard Tkinter if needed)

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the Watermark GUI repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Install the required dependencies using pip: `pip install Pillow`
4. Run the application by executing the following command: `python main.py`
5. The application window will open, allowing you to import an image using the "Add File" button.
6. Customize the text parameters (text, size, font, color, opacity) to your preference.
7. Click on the preview canvas to position the text overlay.
8. Once satisfied with the result, export the watermarked image using the "Export" button.
9. Specify the name and location for the exported image file.
10. The watermarked image will be saved to the specified location.
